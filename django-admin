Create project
	django-admin startproject project-name . (. for directory)
	python manage.py runserver

	(this will start the project)

Info-
	if in settings.py we change the name of the databases to 

	anytime making changes to models.py we have to execute the commands given below

	python manage.py makemigrations
	python manage.py migrate

	when we do python manage.py shell
	-The whole of the project will work inside the python command interpreter. 

Adding products-
	We can add products by two ways.
		-from the django website directly
		-or we can type in the root folder (where the manage.py file is present)
			- python manage.py shell
				-a shell appears and then we can type
					-from products.model import Product #<-products is the app name> 

				to create a product Product.objects.create(title='Newer title', price=12.12, summary='cool')

Also for an error to exist in the admin page in we have to use both 
the makemigrations and migrate command.
